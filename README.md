  - What are the key components of a bug report?

### Week 2: Core Testing Concepts
- Review types of testing: Functional, Non-functional, Regression, Smoke, Sanity, Integration, and Unit Testing.
- Learn about test case design techniques: Boundary Value Analysis, Equivalence Partitioning, Decision Table Testing.
- Understand the defect lifecycle and tools used for defect tracking.

### Week 3: Manual Testing and Documentation
- Practice writing detailed test cases, test plans, and test strategies.
- Learn how to analyze requirements and derive test scenarios.
- Explore sample bug reports and practice writing concise, clear reports.

### Week 4: QA Tools and Basics of Automation
- Get familiar with tools like JIRA, Bugzilla, or TestRail for test management.
- Learn the basics of version control systems like Git.
- Begin exploring Selenium IDE for basic automation tasks.

## Month 2: Intermediate Concepts and Problem-Solving

### Week 1: Coding Basics
- Learn or brush up on a programming language (preferably Python, Java, or JavaScript).
- Practice basic coding concepts: loops, conditionals, arrays, strings, and functions.
- Solve 10-15 beginner-level problems on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank.

### Week 2: Test Automation
- Study Selenium WebDriver for automated UI testing.
- Understand TestNG or JUnit for writing test scripts.
- Learn the basics of API testing using tools like Postman or Rest Assured.

### Week 3: Data Structures and Algorithms
- Focus on essential data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and hash maps.
- Practice sorting and searching algorithms.
- Solve 10-15 intermediate problems related to these topics on coding platforms.

### Week 4: Behavioral and System Design
- Prepare answers for Amazon’s behavioral interview questions using the STAR method.
- Understand the basics of system design (e.g., how testing fits into system architecture).
- Learn about performance testing and basic metrics (e.g., response time, throughput).

## Month 3: Advanced Concepts and Mock Interviews

### Week 1: Advanced Testing Techniques
- Study performance testing with tools like JMeter or LoadRunner.
- Learn about security testing basics (e.g., OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities).
- Explore mobile testing strategies if relevant.

### Week 2: Coding and Debugging
- Solve 15-20 problems focused on QA-related scenarios (e.g., finding bugs in code, writing scripts for testing purposes).
- Practice debugging small code snippets.
- Work on coding challenges specific to QA roles on LeetCode or HackerRank.

### Week 3: Mock Interviews and Feedback
- Conduct mock interviews with peers or mentors, focusing on:
  - Behavioral questions.
  - QA scenarios and case studies.
  - Coding challenges.
- Review feedback and identify areas for improvement.

### Week 4: Final Review and Amazon-Specific Preparation
- Review Amazon’s Leadership Principles and prepare examples for each.
- Practice articulating your experience with QA tools and projects.
- Simulate a full-length interview, including behavioral, technical, and coding rounds.
